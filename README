This is intended to be an initial draft of a telepathy chat window demo. 

It consists of 4 interesting classes for the library.
  - chatview:
This is a widget drawing sent and received messages in a HTML themed sexy way. It does not contain anything particularly telepathy related. This was pretty simple in the end. It currently renders my theme better than Kopete does. Thanks webkit.

  - chatwindow
This widget contains the widget above, an area to type text etc. It also contains all the code to talk from telepathy to the chatview widget.

(I might refactor to get view/logic seperation. Thoughts?)

  - telepathychatinfo and telepathychatmessageinfo are structures (effectively) for passing information to the chatview.

All other classes are just for making a demo application.

It requires Kopete to be installed and to be using a custom Kopete theme. Code currently reads from the Kopete config file.

Once installed, receiving a text channel to your telepathy contact should start this program.

The current telepathy contact list in SVN does not support starting a chat. 

TODO:
  KCModule for configuring theme. Identical to Kopete's I think.
  
  Finish all the template code that I couldn't be bothered to do.

  Polishing on the chatwindow. eventFilter for pressing enter etc.
  
  Rename all the classes to something sensible. I need help with this.

  Split into a library of a chatwidget that any app can use - and an awesome chat program.
  I think we need to split the code as follows:

  lib/ (the chatwindow library, that can be used any program)
  lib/kcmodule (for configuring chat window style)
  app/ (a main chat window application)

  Try adding telepathy into another program to show my lib works as a lib. (maybe Geore's whiteboard program?)

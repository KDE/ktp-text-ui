This is intended to be an initial draft of a telepathy chat window demo. 

It consists of 4 interesting classes for the library.
  - chatview:
This is a widget drawing sent and received messages in a HTML themed sexy way. It does not contain anything particularly telepathy related. This was pretty simple in the end. It currently renders my theme better than Kopete does. Thanks webkit.

  - chatwindow
This widget contains the widget above, an area to type text etc. It also contains all the code to talk from telepathy to the chatview widget.

(I might refactor to get view/logic seperation. Thoughts?)

  - telepathychatinfo and telepathychatmessageinfo are structures (effectively) for passing information to the chatview.

All other classes are just for making a demo application.

Once installed, receiving a text channel to your telepathy contact should start this program.

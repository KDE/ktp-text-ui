This is going to contain the folder for configuring the message view part of telepathy. 

Right now I will build it as an application but eventually it will be a KCModule.

It also needs to compile against the chat window lib, not just recompile all the code with relative paths.

The plan (in my head) is to have this then callable from applications implementing the message view. There is already a KCModule for emoticons.

We also need to decide whether to configure globally or on a "per app using the lib" basis. Advantages to both.

Roadmap:

Make it read/write themename to a config file, and contents of checkboxes

Use this config file in the lib code.

Show a demo chat.

Variants.

KCmoduleify (or even just a widget? Discuss.)

GHNS. Suggest new category in kde-look. Ideally sync Adium to a GHNS source.
